# dtof-sim

Analysis of direct TOF (dToF) timing precision that uses analytical calculations and Monte-Carlo simulations. 

Examples of questions pursued:

* How does TDC bin size effect timing precision?
* How does the noise depend on the number of signal and background photons? 
* Do analytical calculations match the Monte-Carlo results? 

For more details see:

> Koerner, L.J. "Models of Direct Time-of-Flight Sensor Precision that Enable Optimal Design and Dynamic Configuration" IEEE 
Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, to appear. 

The four main files are:

1. *analytical_calcs.py*: functions to calculate the timing precision using the expression dervied from the work of Thompson, et al. 2002 and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).
2. *analytical_plots.py*: functions to plot the analytical results  
3. *histogram_mc.py*: run Monte-Carlo simulations. That are many adjustable parameters controlled by the configuration dictionary `cfg`.
4. *plot_mc.py*: plot the results of the Monte-Carlo simulations.

A top-level script *run_all.py* runs examples of each. This code generates most of the figures in the paper mentioned above.
